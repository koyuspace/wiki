Why? # The verification symbol you might see is just a custom emoji everyone can use. If you want to get actually &amp;ldquo;verified&amp;rdquo; you can verify a website you own and people already trust.
How do I verify my website then? # Any link (including &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; tags) that have the rel=&amp;quot;me&amp;quot; attribute and link back to your profile are considered as a proof and should turn green once you link it back in your profile fields as well.</description></item><item><title>Livestreaming on koyu.space</title><link>https://wiki.koyu.space/docs/streaming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.koyu.space/docs/streaming/</guid><description>Livestreaming on koyu.space # koyu.space got a livestreaming server available at stream.koyu.space.
