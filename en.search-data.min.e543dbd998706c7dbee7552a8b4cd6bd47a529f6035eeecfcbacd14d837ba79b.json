Your server is your property, with your rules. It will exist as long as you want it to exist. You are not isolated on your own server. You can follow anyone on any other server, and they can follow you and you can exchange messages just like if you were on the same server. You can either limit sign-ups to be the only one on the server and run it like personal (micro)blog, maintain an invite-only community for family or friends or run a server anyone can sign up on, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you!  Please mind that providing a public internet service involves moderation work and community management, and that such work becomes more complicated the larger your server grows.  So you want to run your own koyu.space server #  Here is what you need:\n  A domain name. This is how you and others will access your server and how you and your users will be identified on the network.\nHow to get: Namecheap, Gandi, any of the infinite number of domain name registrars. Comes with a yearly cost that varies depending on domain name choice.\n  A VPS. Something that will run the koyu.space code that will always be connected to the internet.\nHow to get: DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Exoscale, Scaleway, any of the infinite number of hosting providers. Comes with a monthly or yearly cost that varies depending on hardware specifications.\n  An e-mail provider. koyu.space needs to send confirmation links and various notifications through e-mail, and hosting your own SMTP server, while possible, is much more difficult to do reliably than to simply use a third-party provider.\nHow to get: Mailgun, SparkPost, Postmark, Sendgrid, any of the infinite number of e-mail hosting providers that expose a SMTP API. Comes with a monthly cost based on volume of e-mails sent.\n  Optional: Object storage provider. koyu.space can save files that you and your users upload on the hard disk drive of the VPS it runs on, however, the hard disk drive is usually not infinite and difficult to upgrade later. An object storage provider gives you practically infinite metered file storage.\nHow to get: Amazon S3, Exoscale, Wasabi, Google Cloud, anything that exposes either an S3-compatible or OpenStack Swift-compatible API. Comes with a monthly cost based on the amount of files stored as well as how often they are accessed.\n  That however does assume a single-machine setup. koyu.space scales quite well horizontally. If your needs outgrow the capacity of a single machine, koyu.space can be divided into multiple app servers, background workers, multiple Redis backends, PostgreSQL replicas.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in installing everything on your own, proceed reading.\nPre-requisites #   A machine running Ubuntu 20.04 or higher that you have root access to A domain name (or a subdomain) for the koyu.space server, e.g. example.com An e-mail delivery service or other SMTP server  You will be running the commands as root.

It is easiest to go with “ident” authentication in a simple setup, i.e. the PostgreSQL user does not have a separate password and can be used by the Linux user with the same username.\nOpen the prompt:\nsudo -u postgres psql In the prompt, execute:\nCREATE USER mastodon CREATEDB; \\q Done!\nSetting up koyu.space #  It is time to download the koyu.space code.

This is because we haven’t started the koyu.space process yet.\nSetting up systemd services #  Copy the systemd service templates from the koyu.space directory:\ncp /home/mastodon/live/dist/mastodon-*.service /etc/systemd/system/ If you deviated from the defaults at any point, check that the username and paths are correct:\n$EDITOR /etc/systemd/system/mastodon-*.service Finally, start and enable the new systemd services:\nsystemctl daemon-reload systemctl enable --now mastodon-web mastodon-sidekiq mastodon-streaming They will now automatically start at boot.\nHurray!

The one command you need to run is rails db:setup which will create the databases mastodon_development and mastodon_test, load the schema into them, and then create seed data defined in db/seed.rb in mastodon_development. The only seed data is an admin account with the credentials admin@localhost:3000 / mastodonadmin.\n Please keep in mind, by default koyu.space will run on port 3000. If you configure a different port for it, the generated admin account will use that number.\n If rails db:setup gives you the Postgres error:\nActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError: FATAL: role \u0026quot;your_user_name\u0026quot; does not exist  (where your_user_name is your username), then run:\nsudo -u postgres createuser your_user_name --createdb  This will create the necessary Postgres user with the permission to create a database.\nRunning #  There are multiple processes that need to be run for the full set of koyu.space functionality, although they can be selectively omitted. To run all of them with just one command, you can install Foreman with gem install foreman --no-document and then use:\nforeman start In the koyu.space directory. This will start processes defined in Procfile.dev, which will give you: A Rails server, a Webpack server, a streaming API server, and Sidekiq.
